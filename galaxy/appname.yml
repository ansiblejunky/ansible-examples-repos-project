# Ansible Roles specific to application `appname`. This helps
# breakup and organize roles specific to an application,
# team, etc. It allows you to run `ansible-galaxy` on
# just a subset of roles instead of the full `requirements.yml`
# which will grow over time. Install only these roles by first
# navigating to the `roles` folder and then running:
# `ansible-galaxy install --force -r appname.yml`

# TIP: Use the `scm` key for repos that do not exist in ansible-galaxy.com!
